⚠️ Update following doc after @babel/preset-react is added to the repo, permanently. The following instructions are outdated and might not be required.

This needs to be added to `.babelrc` before lingui commands can be run. Otherwise lingui doesn't get the right babel presets and `macros` plugin to extract strings.

```
	"presets": ["preact-cli/babel"],
	"plugins": ["macros"],
```

## Why not add it permanently?

Because then app breaks!
